Starting with Github (and Git, and any kind of source control for that matter), I thought why not solve Project Euler problems and save the code here.

There is NO structure in the way I've kept the java and class files. Only lots of files in a single directory! Hopefully, I'll be the only person who will ever go over this repo.
